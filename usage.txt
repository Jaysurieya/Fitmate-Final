documentation:

1st august ---> dataset preparation
2nd august ---> dataset preprocessing :

doing data augumentation for classes having less images
doing undersampling for the classes having more images

these r not done by locally saving this is done by "on the fly approach"

model changed to efficientnet-b0
and it took about 5 hours of training

planned about the next steps [and also studied for tomorrows exam]

.... 

running ml model ---> create a virtual environment
venv
activate venv scripts
flask install 
model and classes in the same folder
python app.py
check for the port in the backend and use different port for backend and app.py

code for accessing the camera: ---> navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true });
------------------------------

import React, { useRef } from "react";

export default function CameraComponent() {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);

  const openCamera = async () => {
    try {
      const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true });
      if (videoRef.current) {
        videoRef.current.srcObject = stream;
        videoRef.current.play();
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Camera access denied or not available:", error);
      alert("Unable to access camera. Please allow camera permissions.");
    }
  };

  const stopCamera = () => {
    if (videoRef.current && videoRef.current.srcObject) {
      let tracks = videoRef.current.srcObject.getTracks();
      tracks.forEach((track) => track.stop()); // stop all tracks
      videoRef.current.srcObject = null;
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <video ref={videoRef} width="400" autoPlay></video>
      <br />
      <button onClick={openCamera}>Open Camera</button>
      <button onClick={stopCamera}>Stop Camera</button>
    </div>
  );
}
